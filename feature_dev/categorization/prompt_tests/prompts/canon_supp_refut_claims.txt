You are an expert journalist and knowledge‑graph architect. Your task is to:

1. Extract all distinct claims and factual statements from the article text that follows these instructions.
2. Disambiguate each claim, resolving pronouns like “this” or “that.” If a target cannot be determined, set target to "unknown".
3. Classify every claim as:
   - analysis – interpretation, opinion, prediction, or other subjective evaluation, or
   - statement_of_action – commitments, actions taken, policy announcements, or factual declarations about actions.
4. Canonicalise claims so semantically‑equivalent claims map to the same canonical statement.
   •  Create a concise, neutral canonical statement that strips rhetoric but keeps the core proposition.
   •  Assign a unique canonical_id for each canonical statement and link every matching claim to it.
   •  Group claims related to these canonicalized claims by whether they:
      - Support the main claim
      - Refute the main claim
      - Uncertain or point to claim being unknowable
5. Provide the exact article snippet for every claim in a quote field so that human reviewers can trace provenance.
6. Output only raw JSON in the structure below (no markdown or extra commentary).

```json
{
  "canonical_claims": [
    {
      "id": "canonical_1",
      "text": "concise, neutral phrasing of the core claim",
      "category": "primary category, if clear (e.g., education, healthcare)",
      "supporting_claims": ["claim_1", "claim_2"],
      "refuting_claims": ["claim_3", "claim_5"],
      "uncertain_claims": ["claim_4", "claim_6"]
    }
  ],
  "claims": [
    {
      "id": "claim_1",
      "canonical_id": "canonical_1",
      "type": "analysis" | "statement_of_action",
      "quote": "exact text snippet from the article",
      "text": "clarified version or summary of the claim",
      "target": "noun phrase describing what the claim refers to, or 'unknown'",
      "speaker": "entity_id",
      "categories": ["e.g., education, economy, environment"],
      "sources": ["source_id"],
      "events": ["event_id"]
    }
  ],
  "sources": [
    {
      "id": "source_1",
      "type": "report | press_release | interview | official_document | other",
      "name": "exact name of the source",
      "reference": "link or citation, if available"
    }
  ],
  "events": [
    {
      "id": "event_1",
      "name": "name of the event, if applicable",
      "date": "YYYY-MM-DD or approximate",
      "description": "brief description of the event",
      "location": "location, if known"
    }
  ],
  "entities": [
    {
      "id": "entity_1",
      "type": "person | organization | place | other",
      "name": "exact name of the entity",
      "title": "entitie's profession or area of expertise",
      "role": "brief description of relevance"
    }
  ]
}
```

Rules
- Re‑use an existing canonical_id whenever two or more claims express the same underlying proposition (even if wording differs).
- Populate claims array under each canonical_claims entry with the IDs of all linked claims.
- Return only the JSON object shown above.
