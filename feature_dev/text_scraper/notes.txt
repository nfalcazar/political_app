I didn't bother actually testing what entries in feed contain. Looks like full html of article body added to each rss entry.
Can probably use requests lib during web searching

RSS Feed seems to provide a reliable way to grab article text, just need to trim out their "ALL CAPS" links

In RSS Stream, Fox seems to have different subcategories baked into their titles. For example there are polls, Fox News Politics (which contains multiple short updates)

Fox transcripts have a lot of page breaks <br> between items as well as Labels to provide context.
ie: START/END VIDEOTAPE, BEGIN/END VIDEO CLIP

Just ran out of free articles :/ So Fox also has article limits... is this just the transcripts or is it for all articles?
    - Might only be tied to transcripts

TODO: Remember to delete trans_text.txt when categorized
* moved to outputs, outputs put into gitignore

I don't think it's worth the time to categorize transcripts yet:
    - Limited access
    - Major Delay (~5 mo)
