Need to figure out how to deal with counter claims.
My assumptions:
    - Using similarity scores from embedding is strong at content relation, but not polarity
        aka:    If a pair of claims prove or deny x person is a criminal. Then similarity scores
                are really good at picking out the person being associated with the word criminal, but not
                wether they say he is or is not.
    - I should be okay with opposite phrasing being seen as two separate claims
        * Difference between saying Biden isn't opening the border and Biden is strengthening the border.
        * x immigration app contained fraudulent refs compared to:
            - x immigration app did not contain frad...
            - x immigration app was correctly filled
