Plan for perp_app_restruct branch:
This is a rewrite of logic / prompts to add DB, Perplexity research, fact processing

A) New DB with edge table to handle all connections
B) Add Perplexity to:
    - Broad research of canon claim (output sent to LLM to extract facts/sources)
    - Primary source finder for facts
C) Add embeddings to facts to attempt to programically match to claims
D) Some way to keep track of links / primary sources across processes

? Should I drop canon claim table, only use embedding table for them?
    how to handle filtered out claims?
    For now, store all processed media into compressed json files


Future plan ideas:
- Add scoring system for determining important claims, finalize filter for claims/facts
- Logic to add "metadata" to various tables
    * GPT says to use hybrid approach, add key terms as actual column names
    * Starting with generic metadata for now, will add terms to columns when seems like they are used a lot
- look into LightRAG, n8n implementation of app

Misc:
- Still want app structure of: logic to locate links to media, logic process links, logic to process facts/claims, ? logic to handle DB ?
